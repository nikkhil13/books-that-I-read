# Sapiens - A Brief History of Mankind

Today, there is only one human species left: **Us. Homo sapiens.** We rule this planet.

Sapiens, the book, takes us on a breath-taking ride through our entire human history, from its evolutionary roots to the age of capitalism and genetic engineering, to uncover why we are the way we are.

As this book is heavy on factual information, this is my attempt to document what I read to help me retain all this fascinating information. 

_Remember - we are all living in an imagined reality._
